# landing-page
This is the project that I am most proud of. I have had so much fun building it and it came out better than I had imagined. 
It was my first time building something with Tailwind CSS and I was scared but excited, because it looked more complex than Boostrap. I like how Bootstrap gives you that familiarity of websites, while Tailwind gives you more of a modern look. I saw a lot of opinions on Tailwind, about how hard it is working with it, but for me it actually wasn't at all. I loved building this Landing Page and if given the chance, I would love to work with Tailwind again.  
And as you can see, I love Playstation, too. :)
